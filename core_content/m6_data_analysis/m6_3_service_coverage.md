## Service Coverage Estimates

This module estimates health service coverage by answering: **"What percentage of the target population received this health service?"**

**Three data sources integrated:**
1. Adjusted health service volumes from HMIS
2. Population projections from United Nations
3. Household survey data from MICS/DHS

### Two-Part Process

**Part 1: Denominator Calculation**
- Calculate target populations using multiple methods (HMIS-based and population-based)
- Compare against survey benchmarks
- Automatically select best denominator for each indicator

**Part 2: Coverage Estimation**
- Override automatic selections based on programmatic knowledge
- Project survey estimates forward using HMIS trends
- Generate final coverage estimates
