## Introduction to FASTR

The Global Financing Facility (GFF) supports country-led efforts to improve the timely use of data for decision-making, ultimately leading to stronger primary healthcare (PHC) systems and better reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition (RMNCAH-N) outcomes. This set of initiatives and technical support is referred to as **Frequent Assessments and Health System Tools for Resilience (FASTR)**.

FASTR encompasses four technical approaches: (1) RMNCAH-N service use monitoring using routine HMIS data, (2) rapid-cycle health facility phone surveys, (3) high-frequency household phone surveys, and (4) follow-on analyses. **This methodology documentation focuses specifically on the first approach: RMNCAH-N service use monitoring.**
