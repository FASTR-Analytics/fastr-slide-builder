## FASTR Approach to Routine Data Analysis

The FASTR approach to routine data analysis takes a three-pronged approach:

1. **Identify issues in data quality**
2. **Adjust for issues with data quality** to improve analysis accuracy
3. **Analyze data to answer pressing country-specific policy questions** including identifying changes in priority service volumes and trends in service coverage as compared to country priorities and targets

This approach enables identification of the highest priority data quality issues and subsequent necessary analytical adjustments so that data can be continually improved while appropriate analyses are conducted. Data quality assessment is conducted by indicator and can be disaggregated at sub-national level given facility-level data is used for the analysis. This is important to generate policy relevant regular reporting on data quality, service volume, and coverage estimates which provides a continual snapshot of RMNCAH-N service use.

### Focus on a Set of Core Indicators

The FASTR approach to routine data analysis focuses on a core set of RMNCAH-N indicators that characterize the reproductive, maternal and child healthcare continuum, priority health areas across LMICs. These indicators capture key service delivery events, which have higher completeness rates and higher volume. In addition, these indicators serve as proxies for other services and interventions delivered at the same service contact. In addition, outpatient consultations (OPDs) are used as a proxy for the general use of health services. Additional, country and program-specific indicators can be added to the analysis to be responsive to country priorities.

### Focus on a Set of Core Data Quality Metrics

The FASTR approach to routine data analysis focuses on a core set of data quality metrics which enables identification of the highest priority data quality issues for which data quality adjustments can be made. In addition to the core data quality measures, the FASTR approach generates an overall data quality score which combines the core metrics into a single summary measure.
